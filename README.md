# Simulocyte

Simulocyte will be released in January 2015. It is a free software for computer simulation of the living cell. It represents molecular cell biology knowledge as a molecular network visualised in interactive 3D interface. With its unique QSSPN simulation engine, the Simulocyte makes molecular network alive. It generates trajectories of molecular events showing how behaviour of the cell emerges from the interaction between the genome and cellâ€™s environment. The simulation of whole-cell molecular network is needed to make full use of molecular biology data in personalised medicine and synthetic biology. Simulocyte can be used online to form user communities building models together. One needs social networks to understand molecular networks. The Simulocyte can be also used as a desktop software.

This version use sails, express, and socket.io for the networking.

It also uses webgl to visualise metabolic networks of the cell using three.js, and combine with visualisations from d3js.

Simulocyte administrator manual: how to install - how to maintain


1 Installation

1.1 On Windows local machine

	1- install mongodb. Then, make sure mongodb is on (you can test that by issuing the command mongo , if it start the mongodb shell without error message that means it works ok, you can then exit it by typing "exit"...). 
		Look at the mongodb documentation or follow these quick steps:  run the Command Prompt as Administrator. 
		Create directories for your database and log files: "mkdir c:\data\db" and "mkdir c:\data\log".
		Create a configuration file at C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg . The file contains the follwing lines:
		systemLog:
			destination: file
			path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
		storage:
			dbPath: c:\data\db
		Create the MongoDB service: sc.exe create MongoDB binPath= "C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --service --config=\"C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg\"" DisplayName= "MongoDB" start= "auto"
		Start the MongoDB service: net start MongoDB
	2- download and install node.js 
	3- download and install robomongo (a little user graphical interface that allows you to modify the mongodb database) at http://robomongo.org/ ). 	
	4- download the .zip file of the simulocyte project and extract it to a folder...
	5- install the sails web framework in your os system path by typing "npm -g install sails@0.9.17"(need a sudo before if you are in linux)
	6- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file and install all the required packages that I use in simulocyte by typing "npm install" (the package.json file contains the list of all these packages if you are interested)
	7- go to /simulocyte folder/node_modules/sails/lib/express/index.js replace the line: bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser(); by: bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser({limit: 18248242});
	8- then go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type "sails lift" in the command line to start the server.
	9- open the Chrome web browser , and look at the url address : http://localhost:1337/ to get started.

1.2 On the sysbio2 Linux server 

	1- install mongodb.
	2- download and install node.js 
	4- download the .zip file of the simulocyte project and extract it to a folder...
	5- install the sails web framework in your os system path by typing "sudo npm -g install sails@0.9.17"
	6- install the forever framework by typing "sudo npm install forever" (this is for running the server in an unkillable process that will restart on its own in case of problem)
	6- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file and install all the required packages that I use in simulocyte by typing "sudo npm install" (the package.json file contains the list of all these packages if you are interested)
	7- go to /simulocyte folder/node_modules/sails/lib/express/index.js replace the line: bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser(); by: bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser({limit: 18248242});
	8- go to the /simulocyte folder/config/ folder and paste the local.js file present in the distribution. This will enable the server to work on the http port nb 80...
	9- make sure that the solver executables (sfba.exe and qsspn.exe) are set in a read write execute permission node (chmod 775)
	10- then go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type "sudo forever start -ae errors.log app.js --dev --port 80" in the command line to start the server in a forever process
	11- open the Chrome web browser , and look at the url address : http://sysbio2.fhms.surrey.ac.uk to get started.


2 Maintenance

2.1 Stopping the server	

	2.1.1 on Windows
		1- just make sure the sails server is stopped in the command line in the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type "Control + C" and "y" to confirm you want to stop the sails server

	2.1.2 on the sysbio2 Linux server 
		1- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type " sudo forever stop app.js --dev --port 80" in the command line to stop the server forever process and change things

2.1 Restarting the server	

	2.1.1 on Windows
		1- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type "sails lift" in the command line to start the server.

	2.1.2 on the sysbio2 Linux server 
		1- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file, and type "sudo forever start -ae errors.log app.js --dev --port 80" in the command line to start the server in a forever process

2.2 Adding a new Model/Controller

	1- stop the server
	2- go to the main simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file. Type "sails generate <name of new model you want to add>"
	3- a model and a controller files will be automatically added to the folder : /simulocyte folder/api/controllers/ and /simulocyte folder/api/models/
	4- make the controller and model files similar to other files present in the system
	5- add the corresponding folder with the name <name of new model you want to add> in the /simulocyte folder/views/ folder
	6- add .ejs files similar to other files present in the system
	7- make sure, if you need to,  to update the file /simulocyte folder/config/bootstrap.js  if you are adding a watcher for reading the changing state of a folder when files are added, changed. or removed
	8- change the file located in /simulocyte folder/.tmp/public/linker/js/app.js to make sure to add the name of the new model controller in the list of sockets (just add it to the already present names)
	7- restart the server

2.3 Changing/adding a new javascript library

	1- stop the server
	2- copy paste the javascript library file into the /simulocyte folder/assets/linker/js/ folder
	3- go to the to the main simulocyte folder file and modify the Gruntfile.js to add the library to the list of existing libraries
	4- if you are just updating an existing library , also make sure to copy/paste the updated version of your library to both the  /simulocyte folder/assets/linker/js/ and the /simulocyte folder/.tmp/public/linker/js/ folders to make sure the system is updates next time you restart the server
	5- restart the server

done!
