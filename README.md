# Simulocyte

## Simulocyte will be released in January 2015. It is a free software for computer simulation of the living cell. It represents molecular cell biology knowledge as a molecular network visualised in interactive 3D interface. With its unique QSSPN simulation engine, the Simulocyte makes molecular network alive. It generates trajectories of molecular events showing how behaviour of the cell emerges from the interaction between the genome and cellâ€™s environment. The simulation of whole-cell molecular network is needed to make full use of molecular biology data in personalised medicine and synthetic biology. Simulocyte can be used online to form user communities building models together. One needs social networks to understand molecular networks. The Simulocyte can be also used as a desktop software.

This version use sails, express, and socket.io for the networking.

It also uses webgl to visualise metabolic networks of the cell using three.js, and combine with visualisations from d3js.

**downloads:**

1- install mongodb

2- install node.js 
3- download and install robomongo (a little user graphical interface that allows you to modify the mongodb database) at http://robomongo.org/

3- download the .zip file of the simulocyte project and extract it to a folder...

4- download metabolic networks .json files that are available ( recon2.v02.xml_metabolic_net.json,  hepatonet1-msb201062-s5.xml_metabolic_net.json, Ec_iAF1260_flux2.xml_metabolic_net.json)

**installation:**

0 - make sure mongodb is on (you can test that by issuing the command mongo , if it start the mongodb shell without error message that means it works ok, you can then exit it by typing "exit"...)

1- go to the simulocyte folder where you can see the package.json file...

2- install the sails web framework in your os path by typing  "npm -g install sails"(need a sudo before if you are in linux)

3- install all the required packages that I use in simulocyte by typing "npm install" (the package.json file contains the list of all these packages if you are interested)

4- go to /simulocyte folder/node_modules/sails/lib/express/index.js
replace the line: 
bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser();
by:
bodyParser = sails.config.express.bodyParser({limit: 18248242});

done!

**Special Note:** A live version of the site will be available soon
